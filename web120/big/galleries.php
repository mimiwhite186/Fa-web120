 <h2>Galleries</h2>
 	<p id="pmar">In recent years, many websites like to add HTML photo gallery to their websites. It not only makes the page look better, but also allows visitors to increase their time on the page. wpDataTables described that when design html image galleries, developers need to pay attention to the speed, responsiveness and overall aesthetics of the web page (2019).  There are many ways to create an HTML photo library , for example, using CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. This article will focus on photo galleries made with jQuery.</p>
	<p id="pmar">Morris(2018) explained that jQuery is pre-written JavaScript code that put in a collection (called a JavaScript library). developers can add the codes to their own coding projects. jQuery allows web developers to plug common JavaScript into web pages so they can spend more time on the complexity function of the site (Morris,2018). This enables developers to write programs more efficiently. Some new learners may not be able to tell the difference between JavaScript and jQuery. The biggest difference is that jQuery is a collection of JavaScript, it is not a language.</p>
