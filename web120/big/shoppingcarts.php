 <h2>Shopping Carts</h2>
 	<p id="pmar">Shopping cart, which is necessary software for e-commerce website, is used to record the merchandise records temporarily stored by consumers. When the consumer checks out, the shopping cart will calculate the total amount of the order and then provides the consumer payment method. According to Markus (2019), there are two types of shopping carts which are hosted and self-hosted shopping carts. A managed shopping cart is a ready-made solution for hosting a shopping cart to the original company. An online store must be registered with the company's host before it can be used and can goes well. Self-hosted shopping carts are customized shopping solutions and hosted on their own servers. Therefore, an online store must download the shopping cart software and run it by self.</p>
	<p id="pmar">When developers create an online shopping cart, there are several issues to consider. They include easy to view order totals, the fast checkout process, the security of payments.</p>
	<ul>
		<li id="pmar">Easy to view order totals</li>
		<p id="pmar">When creating a shopping cart, display the total and detail as much as possible on the page so that consumers are not confused.</p>
		<li id="pmar">Fast checkout process</li>
		<p id="pmar">Minimize unnecessary processes and provide updated checkout progress to make customers feel that checkout is fast.</p>
		<li id="pmar">The security of payments</li>
		<p id="pmar">Developers need to create a comprehensive plan to protect customers' credit card information to prevent online fraud or credit card theft.</p>
	</ul>
	<p id="pmar">Kriss (2019) introduces 3 best e-commerce shopping carts for small businesses, including Shopify, 3dcart, Weebly. Kriss (2019) further explained that Shopify is one of the most famous online shopping cart systems. Its platform is easy to operate and has a different price plan to make it easier for companies to make choices. 3dcart is similar to Shopify and offers different shopping cart plans. However, 3dcart offers more options for payment processing and does not require payment of transaction fees (Kriss, 2019). Unlike 3dcart and Shopify, Weebly is a website builder with web hosting services. Companies can customize their corporate website through Weebly. Companies can also choose the e-commerce shopping cart feature through a selective payment plan(Kriss, 2019).</p>
	<p id="pmar">When choosing an e-commerce shopping cart, companies should consider the type and destination of the online store. Compare and choose the shopping cart that best suits their business.</p>
