	 <h2>Responsive vs Mobile</h2>
 	<p id="pmar">In response to the demand for mobile browsing, more and more enterprises are making their website to responsive or mobile applications. Although the purpose is the same, there are differences between these. Cris explained that responsive design means an enterprise's website is designed specifically for mobile devices. on the other hand, mobile applications are applications that are developed for different operating systems. It has a particular design and codebase (2017).	</p>
	<p id="pmar">Many large enterprises have their mobile applications, such as Starbucks, adidas and Safeway. They have their own mobile applications for marketing and understanding of customer needs and experiences. However, this needs to take into account the cost issue. Not every business can have its own application.</p>
	<p id="pmar">According to Modo Labs Team (2015), as of early 2014, more than 86 percent users spent their time on mobile applications on their mobile devices, while only 14 percent used mobile browsers. As can be seen from these information, users like using mobile applications. Therefore, if an enterprise wants users to be able to visit their website and establish contact, it is necessary to have a mobile application.</p>
	<p id="pmar">Mobile native application is actually using in another way to present the content and functionality of a responsive website. the ways of presenting not only enhances the user experience, but also allows the enterprise to increase its brand exposure. For example, if a user wants to buy clothes by using a website browser, the user may refer to multiple websites. However, if the enterprise has a mobile native application, users can directly click on the enterprise's application, which will achieve the effect of exposure and marketing.</p>
	<p id="pmar">The mobile application is a trend, and it can make web pages viewable and easy to access. However, responsive website is also not useless. It depends on the strategic direction of an enterprise. Understanding the needs and ideas of users can help enterprises find their way.</p>
