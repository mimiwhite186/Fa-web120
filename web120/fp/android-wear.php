	<h1 class="h1al">Wear OS App</h1>
<p id="pmar">Slightly Robot provides a free app for [Android] Wear OS smartwatches that does everything the bracelet does. Please be aware that Slightly Robot only runs on smartwatches running the Wear OS (Android Wear) operating system paired with an Android phone. If you have an iPhone or don't like smartwatches please purchase one of our bracelets instead. We don't support any other watches or peripherals such as Apple Watch, Tizen, Pebble and Fitbit. If you're not sure whether we support a smartwatch or your have any other questions please email us and we'll be happy to help you out.

Due to the proliferation of Wear OS smartwatches we cannot guarantee out software will run on them. Usually it does, but the only one we have thoroughly tested is the LG G Watch.</p>
