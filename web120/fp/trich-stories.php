 	<p id="sub">by Matthew Toles October 15, 2018</p>
	<p id="pmar">I was in second grade and I did something worthy of sending me to time out. I hated it and I remembered tht people in cartoons pull their hair out when they were mad. So, since I was mad I actually started to pull my hair out in clumpps. In fact I can't point specifically to the mayor in the Power Puff Girls cartoon.</p>
