 	<p>Hello!</p>
	<p>Welcome come to Shumi Yang’s Portal Website. I was a web designer and project manager in my hometown. When I was a designer, I found that I was interest in looking html’s code. After I finished my master’s degree in City University in Seattle, I thought it was a good challenge to learn subject I was interested in. So, I am here.</p>
	<p>In this page, I want to interduce some activities that I am interested in and show the pictures. Road trip is very fresh for me that I really want to show my experience.</p>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/roadtrip2.jpg"  alt="" /></td>
				<td>I went Arch National Park a years ago. It was the first time my dad came to the US. We flew to Vegas and started our road trip to Arch National Park. I even don't know how many roads did I drive. We have passed a lot of highway and took many road trips pictures. Road trip is fun, because it is impossible to go road trip in my hometown.</td>
